Powerful speech given by Subhas Chandra Bose birth in Burma in 1944 to the 
Indian National Army .

Born on January 23 , 1897 in Cuttack , Odisha , Subhas Chandra Bose was one of 
India's most popular freedom fighters , who differed with Mahatma Gandhi's 
methods of non-violence and wanted to wage war against our colonial rulers . 
A radical leader in Congress , he became the President of the party in 1938 
but was ousted after differences with Gandhi and the party's high command .

Give me blood , and I shall give you freedom Speech

Friends ! 12 months ago a new programme of total mobilization or maximum 
sacrifice was placed before Indians in East Asia . Today I shall give you 
an account of our achievements during the past year and shall place before 
you our demands for the coming year . But , before I do so , I want you to 
realize once again what a golden opportunity you have for winning freedom . 
The British are engaged in a worldwide struggle and in the course of struggle 
they have suffered defeat after defeat on so many fronts . The enemy having 
being thus considerably weakened , our fight for liberty has become very 
much easier than it was five years ago . Such a rare and Godgiven opportunity 
comes once in a century for liberating our motherland from the British yoke .

I am so very hopeful and optimistic about the outcome of our struggle , 
because I do not rely merely on the efforts on three million Indians in 
East Asia . There is a gigantic movement going on inside India and millions 
of our countrymen are prepared for maximum suffering and sacrifice in order 
to achieve liberty . Unfortunately , ever since the great fight of 1857 , our 
countrymen are disarmed , whereas the enemy is armed to the teeth . Without 
arms and without a modern army it is impossible for a disarmed people to 
win freedom in this modern age . Through the grace of Providence and 
through the help of generous Nippon , it has become possible for Indians 
in East Asia are united to a man in the endeavour to win freedom and all 
the religious and other differences that the British tried to engineer 
inside India , simply do not exist in East Asia . Consequently , we have now 
an ideal combination of circumstances favoring the success of our 
struggle and all that is wanted is that Indians should themselves come 
forward to pay the price of liberty . 

According to the programme of total mobilization  ,  I demanded of you 
men , money , and materials . Regarding men , I am glad to tell you that I 
have obtained sufficient recruits already . Recruits have come to us from 
every corner of east Asia , China , Japan , Indo-China , Philippines , Java , 
Borneo , Celebes , Sumatra , Malaya , Thailand , and Burma .

You must continue the mobilization of men , money and materials with greater 
vigour and energy , in particular , the problem of supplies and transport has 
to be solved satisfactorily .

We require more men and women of all categories for administration and 
reconstruction in liberated areas . We must be prepared for a situation in 
which the enemy will ruthlessly apply the scorched earth policy , before 
withdrawing from a particular area and will also force the civilian 
population to evacuate as was attempted in Burma .

The most important of all is the problem of sending reinforcements in men 
and in supplies to the fighting fronts . If we do not do so , we cannot hope 
to maintain our success at the fronts . Nor can we hope to penetrate deeper 
into India .

Those of you who will continue to work on the Home front should never 
forget that East Asia and particularly Burma form our base for the war of 
liberation . If this base is not strong , our fighting forces can never be 
victorious . Remember that this is a total war  and not merely a war 
between two armies . That is why for a full one year I have been laying 
so much stress on total mobilization  in the East .

There is another reason why I want you to look after the Home Front 
properly . During the coming months I and my colleagues on the war 
committee of the cabinet desire to devote our whole attention to the 
fighting front and also to the task of working up the revolution inside 
India . Consequently , we want to be fully assured that the work at the 
base will go on smoothly and uninterruptedly even in our absence .

Friends , one year ago , when I made certain demands of you , I told you 
that if you give me total mobilization  ,  I would give you a 
second front . I have redeemed that pledge . The first phase of our 
campaign is over . Our victorious troops , fighting side by side with 
Nipponese troops , have pushed back the enemy and are now fighting bravely 
on the sacred soil of our dear motherland .

Grid up your loins for the task that now lies ahead . I had asked you for 
men , money and materials . I have got them in generous measure . Now I 
demand more of you . Men , money and materials have the motive power that 
will inspire us to brave deeds and heroic exploits .

It will be a fatal mistake for you to wish to live and see India free 
simply because victory is now within reach . No one here should have the 
desire to live to enjoy freedom . A long fight is still in front of us . 
We should have but one desire today the desire to die so that India may 
live the desire to face a martyr's death , so that the path to freedom 
may be paved with the martyr's blood .

Friends ! My comrades in the War of Liberation ! Today I demand of you one 
thing , above all . I demand of you blood .  It is blood alone that can avenge 
the blood that the enemy has spilt . It is blood alone that can pay the 
price of freedom . Give me blood and I promise you freedom !
